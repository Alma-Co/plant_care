# plant_care

I start this app because my plants are suffering from my forgetful mind. I tend to overwater them, then I totally stop for a while and forget. This morning I saw one in a pitiful state, I watered it and put it to sunbath and she is precious again now. 
It is a just a matter of caring, that's why I made this app and I chosed Vue because I want to learn this framework.. voil√†
